# c-f-covertion


Write a C++ program that accepts a number followed by a letter as shown in the figure. If the letter following the number is ‘c’, the program should take the number entered as a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, convert the number to the equivalent degrees Celsius, and display a suitable message. If the letter following the number is ‘f’, the program should take the number entered as a temperature in degrees Celsius, convert the number to the equivalent degrees Fahrenheit and display a suitable message. If the letter is neither f nor c, the program is to display a message that the data entered is incorrect. Use the following relationship. 
 
Celsius = (5.0 / 9.0) × (Fahrenheit - 32.0) 
Fahrenheit = (9.0 / 5.0) × Celsius + 32.0
 
Use switch statements for your program 
  <see Instructions.pdf for sample input and output>
 
Hint: Take two inputs in parallel when considering ‘number followed by a letter’
